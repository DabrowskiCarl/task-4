                            [Verse 1: Macklemore]<br>
                            I wanna be sober, but I love gettin' high<br>
                            Wanna give it a hundred percent, but I'm too afraid to try<br>
                            I wanna be faithful, but love hookin' up with randos<br>
                            I wanna live by the law, but still think like a vandal<br>
                            I wanna get exercise, but I'm too lazy to workout<br>
                            I want all the finer things, but don't wanna go to work now<br>
                            I wanna go outside, take my family to the beach<br>
                            I wake up in the morning, first thing I do is look at a screen, at a screen</p>

                    <p>
                            [Pre-Chorus: Macklemore]<br>
                            Wanna live freely, why isn't it so easy?<br>
                            I should read a book, but I keep watchin' this TV<br>
                            And I know this lifestyle doesn't really feed me<br>
                            I just tune out to the voice inside that's speaking</p>
                    <p>
                            [Chorus: Dan Caplen]<br>
                            All my little problems keep on buildin' up, and buildin' up<br>
                            All my good intentions just ain't good enough, can't find the love<br>
                            So I smoke until my lungs are full<br>
                            And drink until I lose my cool<br>
                            Apology's my middle name, and one day I will change, but<br>
                            I'm okay with who I am today<br>
                            I'm okay with who I, who I am today</p>

                            I want world peace, but I wanna watch Worldstar<br>
                            I know that I should stay home, and still wanna kick it where the girls are<br>
                            I wanna be a feminist, but I'm still watchin' porno<br>
                            I wanna eat healthy, but I'ma eat this DiGiornos<br>
                            We live on social media, read other people's thoughts<br>
                            Tweet about justice, but don't show up to the march<br>
                            I think about the earth, and I think about the eco<br>
                            What am I willin' to sacrifice at the expense of my ego?</p>
